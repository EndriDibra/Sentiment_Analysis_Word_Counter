# Sentiment_Analysis_Word_Counter
Hello dear friends!
This is a classic project about sentiment analysis
and is written in Python. I used NLP library: textblob.
The programme counts the positive and negative words of a text,
taken by the user as an input.
In case that there are neither positive nor negative words in the text,
the program displays that the input(text) is neutral.
Type on your terminal: pip install textblob
