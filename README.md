# Sentiment_Analysis_Word_Counter
Hello dear friends!
This project is all about sentiment analysis and is written in Python.
The program counts the positive and negative words of a text, taken by the user as an input.
In case that there are no positive either negative words in the text, the program displays that the input(text) is neutral.
